# BaseFPUnityProject

## Intro
Over the past couple of years whenever I have started a new Unity project I find my self spending a few hours to a few days recreating a first person character just so that I could finally start testing any ideas that I might of originally wanted. This lead me to creating this Repo where I have a basic first person character based on Breckys first person tutorial (If I can make/find a better option will implement that instead) and adding some extra things that I normally like to have in my character. At the same time many of the turorials are made for the old movement system which isent as friendly for having diffrent controllers working which is why I also implimented the new input system and Im planning over time implementing more controller support.

## Current features
- Movement (Character controller)
- Camera looking
- Jumping

## Features I wish to impliment
- Picking up items
- Melee combat
- Firearm (Shooting) combat
- Health
- Healing over time
- Camera bobbing while walking
- Crouching
- Inventory (Both quick by changing through mouse wheel and backpack style of inventory)
- UI (Mostly to show that the other features are working)

## Features future implimentation
### Depending on how fast I complete the other features and if I feel like this are interesting things to still implementing
- Wall running
- Throwables
- Grapple gun
- Blocking

## Things I am currently not planning on implementing
- Animation. There will be Debug.Log() that can show current values and some basic UI to demonstrate when certain things are active.
- Sound. This might be to much since it can be very diffrent depending on the game each person is planning on making and it would be very hard to make enough audio clips for each situation that a person can find themselves in. Especially for the scope of this project.
